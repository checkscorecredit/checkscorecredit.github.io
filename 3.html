For example:</p> the amount of money you’ve borrowed the number of credit applications you’ve made whether you pay on time <p> Depending on the credit reporting agency, your score will be between zero and either 1,000 or 1,200.</p> <p> The score relates to a five-point scale (excellent, very good, good, average and below average).

This could mean getting a better deal and saving money.</p> <p> A lower score will affect your ability to get a loan or credit. See how to improve your credit score .</p> <h2> Get your credit report for free</h2> <p> If you've ever applied for credit or a loan, there will be a credit report about you.</p> <p> It's worth getting a copy of your credit report once a year.
